## What is myDashCam Datasets
The Malaysian DashCam Datasets (myDashCam) is an initiative work that aims to analyse and understand videos recorded via DashCams. It is the first annotated malaysian DashCam dataset that is primarly collected and annotated for resreach purposes.

## The Dataset

### The Video Files

The videos can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yhn4ouQbQrhJqX0g1Z808AXoF0oz35PG/view?usp=sharing) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### The Annotation File
